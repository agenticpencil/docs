> Your agentic content strategist. Know what to write.

AgenticPencil is a content strategy API that turns AI visibility intelligence, keyword research, and competitor analysis into a prioritized content map. One API call — your next 100 articles, ranked by impact.

## What AgenticPencil does

- Content Mapping: Full topic clustering, prioritization, and content gap analysis. Pass a domain, get back a ranked list of exactly what to write and why.
- AI Visibility Intelligence: Real browser-based monitoring of every major AI model (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Mode, Copilot). Not API calls — actual user interface scraping.
- Sitemap Cannibalization Audit: Detects pages competing against each other for the same queries. Identifies what to consolidate, redirect, or leave alone.
- Competitor Cross-Analysis: Map your content against up to 10 competitors. See every topic they cover that you don't and where AI models are citing them instead of you.
- Multi-Geography Intelligence: Run analysis across 50+ countries. AI visibility tracked per-region across all major models.
- Enterprise Writer API: 14-step content pipeline with brand guidelines, schema markup, internal linking, and direct Webflow publishing.
