### ROI Calculator

For a Pro Plan user ($49/month):
- **1,000 credits = $0.049 per credit**
- **Keyword research = $0.245 per call** (5 credits)
- **Content audit = $0.735 per call** (15 credits)

Compare to:
- Freelance SEO consultant: $75-150/hour
- Enterprise SEO tools: $300-1,000/month
- Manual research time: 20-40 hours/month saved

<Tip>
  **Break-even analysis**: If you save just 1 hour per month at a $50/hour rate, the Pro Plan pays for itself.
